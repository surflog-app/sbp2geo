The SBP file format is fairly simple. It has the following main structure:

[START]
[64 BYTES - HEADER]
[32 BYTES - POINT 001]
[32 BYTES - POINT 002]
[32 BYTES - POINT 003]
[...]
[32 BYTES - POINT nnn]
[END]

It seems that the byte at offset 30 of a point chunk says if it's the start of a track, or isn't.
This is needed to split the tracks, but this conversion library simply merges all points together
into one big track.
